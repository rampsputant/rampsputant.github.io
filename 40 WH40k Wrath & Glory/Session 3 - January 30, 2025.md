## Strong Start - Summons from Varonius
**Location: Bridge**
**NPC: Varonius**
Varonius has judged the operators are useful at dealing with complex and difficult situations. He has two jobs where he believes their work could be useful. He asks them to choose based on where they think they would best excel.

The influential ruler of Avachrus, Archdomina Vakuul, has requested assistance in locating and securing a missing artifact. Vakuul is looking for operators who can be discrete and who are discreet and can avoid attracting too much attention. Varonius is keen to have Vakuul in his debt as the current ruler of Avachrus. Additionally, having a tech-priest of Avachrus in the party could open some doors.

Varonius will forward the mission briefing details and next steps to their Dataslates. He grants them access to a Valkyrie ship and access to any common or uncommon Imperial-keyed equipment 
## Welcome to Avachrus
> Buried beneath the surface of Avachrus’s surface wasteland is an endless warren of colossal machinery. Ceaseless industrial activity, without wind or rain to offer cool respite, drives the city’s temperature to the limit of Human endurance. The sheer scale of Belaxia Foundry-Forge is barely conceived by its residents, few of whom travel beyond their Cult-assigned manufactorum, where they are ordained to live, work, praise the Omnissiah, and perish.
> 
> Between the massive industrial centres scraping a sky of iron sheathes, wide transportation conduits ferry raw materials and Tech-Priest retinues. The theocrats of Belaxia fight a losing battle to catalogue every excavated route through the city, for tectonic shifts, mining operations, and political machinations constantly open new tunnels and rediscover old, forgotten ones. You've been sent to meet an influential employer in one of these secret subways, undetected by the manufactora’s omnipresent servitor-surveillance.

#### This Message will Self Destruct
**Location: Belaxia Service Tunnel
NPC: Servitor (Achdomina Vakuul)**
- Lobotomized servitor, lower jaw and ears replaced with a two-way vox unit
- Light on its back flcikers to light; vox units and dataslates are deactivated
- distorted, confident voice; emotionless corpse body
	- 3 days ago, secret facility attacked. Valuable stasis coffin stolen
	- Belongs to powerful, unforgiving associates. Must be recovered before they learn the truth. Discretion is critical
	- Other suspects: Rival foundry forges, the Secutarii of Kauradar (Titan Lord Legionaires on the other side of the panet)
	- Begin investigation at tech-crypt
	- (lie) - she does not know what the stasis coffin contains
	- Reward offered: 4 wealth in cogitator parts plus a favor from Vakuul. 2 wealth up front as retainer.
- Servitor hurls itself into recycling vent

#### Scene of No Crime
**Location: Tech Crypt**
**NPCs:** Tango-Mic, Mechanicus Custodian
- Small crypt surrounded by production fortresses; guarded by Skitarii rangers. Tango-Mic refuses entrance until they convince him.
	- Complication: Tango mic will report this to his superiors (advance the clock)
- Inside, stone chambers housing brain-jars festooned with complex wiring and gilded skeletons bearing blinking augmetics
- Custodians and guards seem willfilly obvlivious to bloodstains and bullet marks
- Body bags piled in the corner
- Stairs leading down
	- stasis-chamber, where hundreds of power conduits run to an obviously empty space
- Tango-Mic
	- Security tightened due to recent gang violence
		- Social check: gangs operate out of Belaxia's underground levels
	- Pretends that nothing else is amiss
- Custodians (Lorton) - operating various cogitators and monitoring settings.
	- Describe tall, thin, pale, carrying a heavy-looking book 
	- They pretend nothing is wrong - "power levels are more efficient than ever"
	- Social check to get the Personnel Logs (not offered) 
- Bodies
	- Charred remains; ruptures along nervous systems
	- DN3 Medicae - massive shock of bioelectricity
	- DN4 scholar / tech - Fulgurite Electro-priests use electroleech staves known to cause such injuries. 
- Personnel Logs
	- Discovered via Investigation check or by asking about book
	- Carried by Custodian Lorton
- If they ask about Biran Amiga, they learn that he hasn't been seen since the day of the attack but he is not among the dead.

> **Octavianus knows:** Every tech-adept on Avachrus is fitted with an identification electoo, a subdermal implant that provides access to secure systems and provides a record of their activities. 

> **Octavianus knows:** The Electro-Priests are fanatical devotees of the Motive Force, the third of the Machine God’s trinity that supplies energy to all life and machines. This sect belongs to the Fulgurite denomination, which holds the Motive Force is a limited resource and demands careful husbanding of all sacred energy to ensure no essence of the Omnissiah is wasted.

#### Underground Underworld
Location: The Tune-Up Cybersurgery Bar
NPCs: Skreiner (cybersurgeon), Zeth (patient in for a tuneup)
- Describe tangle of pipes, dingy, slipshod structures between and below the giant factories and streets above.
- Loud electronic music pumping out of bars. Drug addicts and people with badly installed augmetics. There are no Skitarii about.
- Where do they look? Who do they ask? Cunning DN 4, advantage for Scum. 
	- On fail, advance the clock as they waste a bunch of time
	- Depending on approach, they may make some enemies - if this happens, run the tech ganger encounter and leave a clue pointing to the Tune-Up Cybersurgery Bar.


- Screams of unlicensed surgery
- Offer discounted augmetics
- Skreiner directs them to Zeth
- Zeth willing to trade info with a DC3 test. What's he want? Cash, or a Plasma Pistol

**Random encounter in underworld** - 2 Tech Gangers and 4 Scum. 
Location
NPC: Tech-ganger
- First a skeevy looking guy with patchy cyberware asks them for directions. He stalls and asks them questions, if he can sell them anything, what they're doing there.
	- Trying to surround the PCs so they can seize the initiative. If he keeps them talking, there is surprise.
- They've heard of the Hardwares - confirm details. 

#### Church Confessional
Location: The Church of Dwindling Existence 
NPC: High Luminen Ossifa

- Do they know how the Fulgerite Electro-Priests can be found here?
- How do they get there?

- Near Belaxia’s city limits
- Inside the temple it is dark and oppressive, only light flickering glow of priests tattoos.
- If questioned, tech-disciples direct them to High Luminen Ossifa, who hosts the Agents in a spartan chamber of engraved stone
- Her golden skin ripples with potential energy, grounded by an electroleech stave capped with a sharpened pick. She is honest and direct
	- cheerfully admits to attacking the Tech Crypt
	- tipped off about the Tech Crypt by the Secutarii of the Legio Karutho
	- horrified to discover the massive amounts of wasted energy powering the stasis-coffin.
	- hired a gang called the Hardwares, a crew of tech-gangers distinguished by their blood-red cybernetic arms. The Hardwares were the cannon fodder, whilst she provided Tech-Priest authorisation access.
	- The attack was a success. They tore out the stasis-coffin, and ended the blasphemous waste of energy.
	- Ossifa doesn’t know what was in the stasis-coffin, and she doesn’t care. She left it with the Hardwares, along with the tech-adept supervisor in charge of the thing. They mentioned escaping aboard the Stronos Space Elevator

#### Long Day at the Office
Location: Belaxia (general)

- How do they track down Amiga?
	- City records (influence DN 5)
	- Hacking surveillance (DN 7)
	- Historic surveillance footage inside the tech crypt
	- Records in the crypt
	- Failure results in complication that takes longer and advances the clock
- They can learn the following:
	- Biran Amiga hasn’t visited his home or work since the attack.
	- He has used his adept credentials to reserve transportation capacity in the Stronos Space Elevator destined for the Delta-Sig-Novem orbital platform. Transit tomorrow
	- He worked constantly, never leaving the stasis-coffin
	- He filed a requisition order to install a hydration unit at his workstation, so he could attend the stasis-coffin longer without refreshment breaks.
	- Amiga is constantly muttering a one-sided dialogue with the stasis-coffin 

#### One More Thing
