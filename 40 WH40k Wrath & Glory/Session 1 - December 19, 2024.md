#### Recap & Factions
- For various reasons, rendered unto the service of the Rogue Trader, Jakel Varonius.
- Krunk - his squad commander didn't like him and wanted to get rid of him
- Octaviano - serves the Tech priests on Avarchus - commanded to serve the rogue trader and in secret to recover holy tech relics if possible
- Barry - a psycher from the black ships rendered unto Jakel Varonius' care. He has been serving in the Astropaths Chorus until recently when he was taken into service.
- Chris's character - a death cultist who was once in the ministorum, and became obsessed with the ancient teachings of holy murder. When he murdered one of the priests who was guilty of the crime of depravity, he was cast out as too extreme. Since then, he has worked as a punisher of the guilty and sought a lord in whom he can put his faith.


## Strong Start - Meeting with Kandlan
**Scene: Administratum Barracks
Character: Rashida**
Rashida Kandlan (bemused, harried, beat cop) leads the character back to the Administratum Barracks, where she offers them refreshments (purified water) and plates full of raw fish innards. There are lines of citizens queuing in front of desks of a weary looking clerk.

She apologizes for the situation at the landing pad. She explains that before the Rift, Enoch saw hundreds of thousands of pilgrims a year - most from wealthy families - come to view the Imperial Shrines and sculptures of the Shrine World. But when the Great Rift opened 3 years ago, the pilgrims were trapped here as refugees.
- The Ecclesiarchy helped at first, but there were riots, some priests got strung up, then the purges came, and after that, the Ecclesiarchy has mostly turned a blind eye.

Gangs have risen up in the refugee camps; they test the town of Mourncleft by getting groups of desparate refugees worked up and sending them to attack the landing pad or the walls of the town. She can barely keep them at bay. But unless they've got food and transport for 50,000 lost souls, that's not why she brought them here.

She tells them:
> While starvation is always a problem on Enoch, so too is fresh water. Enoch’s oceans are brine — non-potable to unaugmented Humans. There are desalination units, but they are ancient, their machine spirits are cantankerous, and there is never enough water to go around.
> 
> A new cult has arisen within the local slums called the Water Bringers, said to be led by a Saint
> who brings forth miracles in the form of fresh, flowing water. The cult is growing rapidly. Kandlan’s brief investigation into the Water Bringers brought very mixed results; word on the street is the Water Bringers are faithful to the Emperor, and generously share their water with all. Conflicting rumours abound, with some claiming the cult charge ruinous prices for water, others that it is a pious front for a villainous gang of scammers.
> 
> The Ecclesiarchy is very interested in talk of a Saint, as any unbacked claim of Sainthood is an
> unforgivable heresy. Kandlan charges the characters with infiltrating the Water Bringers, determining the truth of the Saint’s status — unsanctioned Psyker, heretic, or overlooked blessed of the Emperor — then rendering their judgement. They are to decide what is to be done and do it — as trusted agents of the Imperium and representatives of order within the Gilead System, > none will question their decision. 
> 
> Kandlan suggests that ingratiating themselves with the Water Bringers might be their best move, but a bit of applied sleuthing wouldn’t hurt.

If the PCs question the citizens, most of them are complaining about the rates they're getting for their catch and about the cut the administratum is taking to feed the miscreants and filth outside of their village.

If the PC's question Rashida further:
- She's the only enforcer - there should be 50 for the size of the shantytown but the administratum established the staffing levels 100 years ago and hasn't done another assessment since then
- She doesn't know much about the Watre Bringers or the other groups other than there are some pretty terrible rumors
- Rumors of criminals, cults with questionable beliefs, some even say there are cannibals out there
- They used to be proud, wealthy families from across the Imperium. Many came here to Enoch to view the 1000-year old Imperial Shrines as part of a pilgrimage. When the Great Rift appeared, they were trapped here. 
- She doesn't know or care much one way or the other about Varonius, but it's hard to find help out here, and she'll take what she can get. If it means Varonius gets a cut, the Ecclesiarchy may not like it, but it doesn't matter to her if it helps to calm the masses and stop the assaults on the town.
#### Feeding Time
A buzzer sounds, and Kandlan notes that it is ‘feeding time’, asking the characters to follow her. She leads them towards Mourncleft’s fortified wall as twilight descends on the village. As they walk, she points at the titanic statue to the north :
***‘Tygranas keeps an eye on us all, my Lords. Why, that’s the fifth largest statue of him on the planet!’***

Several villagers with rough appearances and augmetics incorporating lacquered wood approach,
carrying buckets of fish viscera, heads, bones, and various slightly disturbing tentacled parts.

***‘The Adepts get their due first, and well, we try to give what we can to the pilgrims. It’s not much, but it’s something for their pots.’***

As they approach the wall, the characters easily hear what sounds like hundreds of shouting people on the far side of it. Kandlan directs the characters to a shuttered blind at the top of the wall near a gun emplacement, where they can look out without being seen. There are hundreds of people along the wall, mostly standing in groups. The majority are dressed in rags. Many are brightly lit up with glowing skinplants in vibrant colours along their arms, and occasionally,
faces. A wave of pungent odors strike the characters; the crowd is rank, worse than the fish offal

**Observations - Call for Awareness Tests
- Kandlan points out the ones with blue-green skin implants are likely the Water Bringers.
- The crowd seems to part for them.
- There's another group with red and silver skinplants - many of them are carrying makeshift weapons. The crowd parts for htem as well. Rashida doesn't know who they are.

Faustus Cherube
#### Shantytown
**Scene: The Slums**
**Character: Charlie Scavver**
Kandlan encourages them to depart at once, though she can be swayed to providing them with lodging with an Influence test. She shows them a tunnel beneath the wall that allows them to slip out into an abandoned and reeking bunker outside the village wall.

The shantytown surrounding Mourncleft is enormous, brightly coloured, and smells abysmal. It is loud with the sounds of people, but the heavy chugging of industry, vehicles, and other Imperial machinery is conspicuously absent (which may disturb some characters). The only sources of light are fires, the glow of personal skinplants, and a few jealously guarded sputtering electronic lumens.

Allow Cunning, Persuasion, Investigation, or Intimidation tests to gather information - or clever roleplaying. General info gathered:
- The Water Bringers are perceived as being well-liked. A successful Persuasion or bribe will convince someone to lead them there.
- "Saint Martika will save us all!"
- Some claim The Water Bringers give their services for free, others that they barter for water. But all agree their water is pure.
- If asked about the red-skinplanted gang, people become frightened or disturbed. They are called the Deluge. They are also water dealers, but they're a dangerous sort and only the most powerful gangs or the most desperate deal with them.

If I need an NPC, add in **Charlie Scavver**, a mutant who calls everyone '**guvner**' and whose arms are longer than his legs so that he looks kind of like a gorilla. He will agree to lead the PCs to the Water Shrine. He's actually a wannabe member of the Deluge and he will go to tell them about the PCs in hopes of getting in their good favor.

#### The Water Shrine
**Scene: The Water Shrine
Character: Tybalt**
Use the campaign notes - Tybalt agrees to let them attend and observe the holy ceremony of Saint Martika if they will help them get rid of the leaders of the Deluge.

#### The Desalination Station
**Scene: The Slums
Character: Xul**

**Scene: The Basement**

### Render Judgement
**Scene: Holy Masses
Character: Saint Martika

As the ritual proceeds, Barry detects psychic energy being channeled. Call for a psychic test. 
If they attack, they fight Martika and cult leader and cultists who try to protect her. Also hordes of innocent simpltons get in the way.

If they wait to see the ritual through, Barry detects something is wrong, he hears whispering. If he asks to make a psyker test to determine what is wrong, make him roll conviction or suffer corruption. His difficulty will be higher than others who face the Pink Horror.

Her body rips open and a pink horror comes out, ripping apart her followers in a fury of claws.

**Scene: Chaos Erupts**
