## Character Creation
- Step-by-Step Walkthrough

## Strong Start - Mission Briefing
**Jakel Varonius** assembles the characters on the bridge of his void ship, where he holds court to visiting dignitaries and his trusted allies.
- Wants you to look into a troubling matter on Gilead System's shrine world, Enoch.
- Issue with the water supply. The peasants have some new source of water that's causing an uproar with the Ecclesiarchy. Is it some ancient water filtration machine the peasants have gotten working, a rumor, or worse, some heresy? 
- Varonius sees it as a potential threat to financial gains from water import, and if there is something valuable, he wants the PCs to retrieve it or lay claim to it. If there is a religious matter, he wants it dealt with before the Inquisitors come snooping.
He says the PCs will be meeting with Enforcer Rashda Kandlan in the town known as Mourncleft. 

He will answer any questions about Enoch and the system.  

He has outfitted the characters with their gear and given them access to an Aquila Lander to take to the surface.

They can requisition other gear if they wish.

#### Piloting the Lander
They are strapped into the onceopulent seats of an Aquila Lander, a high-end Imperial transport craft. The interior of the Lander is lit by candles and the glow of a hololith  — which projects flat hologram pits of Enoch with accompanying information.
- Enter atmosphere, warning klaxons and the holoith projection blinks and shudders.
- Pilot test or Tech test to gain control. DN 2

The Lander approaches Mourncleft just before sunset. The village is shaped like a large ‘V’ wrapped about a deep crevasse that parts a set of towering shoreline cliffs. Boats of various sizes hang in the crevasse, well above the churning surface of the ocean, each connected by long cables to mechanical winches on top of the cliff. To the north, a large mountain rises, easily 3,000 metres tall. Atticus notices that one face has been carved into an exacting likeness of Tygranas Dalir, former Chapter Master of the Absolvers, gargantuan and gazing out to sea.

#### Landing
Mourncleft appears to have less than fifty buildings. A curving fortified wall with gun emplacements surrounds the village, all the way to the cliffs. Beyond the village, a shantytown stretches off towards the horizon. As the sun sets, hundreds 
of street fires spring to life.

As they exit the lander in the shipyard, they hear what sounds like hundreds of shouting people just outside the landing pad. An Enforcer in battle-scarred, tattered gear is trying to calm the mob, shouting and waving a gun around. There is no other security to be seen.

The ENforcer cries out warning - the mob isn't going to be held off. THey're going to have to be driven back. Fight!

- Mob of 10 - use Cultist stats.
- Each round, they throw 3 improvised firebombs
	- Target PC, Athletics DC 2 to avoid
	- If fail, On Fire

Aftewards, meet Kandlan

#### Kandlan
Enforcer Rashida Kandlan has grey eyes and unusual scarring around her mouth. Kandlan was born on Gilead Prime, and worked for decades as an Enforcer amongst the smog-filled lower levels of Hive Calumina. She had an augmetic rebreather installed when she was a teenager to ensure the noxious chemical air didn’t damage her lungs, and now that it is removed, she takes every opportunity to breathe in the fresh sea air deeply.

Play Kandlan as a bemused, harried law enforcer. She is very happy to see the characters, and explains that an Administratum survey judged one Enforcer enough to police Mourncleft and the surrounding region. It has been a century since that survey was conducted, and Kandlan estimates that she should have at least fifty fellow Enforcers to police the current population. But it’s just her — and now the characters.

She explains that these mob attacks have been increasing. Gangs in the slums and shantytowns use the promise of food and freedom to incite rioters. 

She asks if they are hear about the Water Bringers. She invites the PCs to come to the Barracks to discuss the matter. END SESSION
