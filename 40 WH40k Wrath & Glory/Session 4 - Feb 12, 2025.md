## Overview
Follow the leads. Go to the Stronos Space Elevator.**

### Last Session Summary:
- Barnard VanderScorn tracked down Raoul and they chatted. VanderScorn wants Raoul to bring him Xenos tech or info. Raoul relucatnt. Vanderscorn offered to share who threw Raoul out of that plane. Raoul reluctantly accepts agreement. Not sure how much choice he really has
- Techmagos Cantor asks Octaviano to bring any pre-imperial tek he finds
- Team accepts mission. Raoul mentions bringing xeno and heretek onto the ship. Gisbern freaks out, wants to kill them all. Raoul blames Vanderscorn.
- Gisbern believes the transmitter he has will call down a nuclear strike
- Tech Crypt
	- They found a secret tunnel leading into underworld, with evidence that the raiders had come that way
	- They found burns on bodies but didn't ask about or follow that clue
	- They found Amiga's jacket, which after examining had heretical markings on it. Gisbern freaked out, wants to destroy. Octaviano rolled corruption test and passed
	- They also found Amiga's dataslate. Octaviano started hacking. 8 more hours needed.
	- Almost got into a fight with Skitarii. Skitarii reporting them (trigger Lockson). 
	- Party wonders why all new guards and custodians. Who ordered it? Skitarii point them to Lord Captain Tekanos
	- Scrape marks indicate stasis-coffin dragged out the front
	- They tried and failed to steal an ancient augmetic implant from the crypt
- Administratum offices - used influence to bypass lines and met with a bureaucrat named Apakov Middencowl. Middencowl solicited a bribe to expedite their request. Took 2 hours to produce Amiga's address
- Amiga's Apartment
	- No sign of Amiga for 6 months; validated by his neighbor
	- No clues or evidence on site
- Lockson!
	- Party aggressive towards Lockson from moment he appears, dragging him in by lapels, Ocaviano bodily searching him, veiled threats from Gisbern
	- Lockson seems to have convinced them he's just an investigator
	- Someone says we don't want the Inquisition finding out about this.
	- They ask about the underworld and Lockson points them to the Tune Up
	- Gisbern warns Lockson that his case is over.
	- Note that they did NOT mention what was stolen
- Clues still to follow
	- They can still hack the dataslate for a feed and travel records
	- The Tune Up in underworld
	- They could always consider the corpse injuries again
- Consider tipping off the agents somehow that an imperial inquisitor is involved
#### Game Prep
- Fix landing page
- Add Mission Data

## Intro
- Recap session - the mission and what they've learned thus far
- 2 Wrath points
- 

## Strong Start - Recap from the last session
Determine what the PCs are going to do next.

The Inquisition is at Stage 3.
- Throughout the next couple days, the PCs are being followed by one of Lockson's Enforcers (Obed Wilk). 
	- If players ask specifically if anyone is following them, call for Awareness tests, DN 3
	- If the players generally are just searching an area, describe two or three randos appropriate to the scene  and describe the enforcer:
		- (r) 2 Skitarii rangers on patrol 
		- (r) Servitor carrying a long segment of pipe
		- (E) man in a tech-adept robes with no visible prostethics
		- (r) woman with cheap-looking implants, electoos, and shaved head watching them (random ganger)
- As long as the PCs do not confront the Enforcer, he gathers information on their activities and whereabouts and the clock advances to Step 4 as the PCs get on the elevator. See Part 3
	- If the PCs confront the enforcer, he first claims to be just an ordinary citizen. This deception is easy to see through (DN 1 Insight).
	- His second lie is that he works for the Belaxian Criminial Investigation Unit alongside Agent Lockson, and he was sent to keep an eye on them.
		- DN 3 Insight for this lie
	- If the PCs tell a convincing enough story after sussing out the lie, Wilk will reveal who he is.
	- If the PCs threaten him and roll less than a DN 6, Wilk will flee and summon aid in the form of four enforcers.
- Remember that once the PCs are aware of Lockson's investigation, they can try to slow him down, leaving him stuck at Stage 3.

#### Underground Underworld
Location: The Tune-Up Cybersurgery Bar
NPCs: Skreiner (cybersurgeon), Zeth (patient in for a tuneup)
- Describe tangle of pipes, dingy, slipshod structures between and below the giant factories and streets above.
- Loud electronic music pumping out of bars. Drug addicts and people with badly installed augmetics. There are no Skitarii about.
- Where do they look? Who do they ask? Cunning DN 4, advantage for Scum. 
	- On fail, advance the clock as they waste a bunch of time
	- Depending on approach, they may make some enemies - if this happens, run the tech ganger encounter and leave a clue pointing to the Tune-Up Cybersurgery Bar.

- Screams of unlicensed surgery
- Offer discounted augmetics
- Skreiner directs them to Zeth
- Zeth willing to trade info with a DC3 test. What's he want? Cash, or a Plasma Pistol

- If the Agents present themselves as especially convincing black market merchants — and are willing to spend Wealth, or trade Mechanicus secrets to reinforce the deception — t**hey are approached by a representative of the Hardwares**. The fixer advises that his associates are arranging an auction of ‘specialist items’ the Agents might be interested in, and invites them to the sale on Odo. This gives the Agents a much better idea what to expect in Part Three.

**Random encounter in underworld** - 2 Tech Gangers and 4 Scum. 
Location
NPC: Tech-ganger
- First a skeevy looking guy with patchy cyberware asks them for directions. He stalls and asks them questions, if he can sell them anything, what they're doing there.
	- Trying to surround the PCs so they can seize the initiative. If he keeps them talking, there is surprise.
- They've heard of the Hardwares - confirm details. 

#### Church Confessional
Location: The Church of Dwindling Existence 
NPC: High Luminen Ossifa

- Do they know how the Fulgerite Electro-Priests can be found here?
- How do they get there?

- Near Belaxia’s city limits
- Inside the temple it is dark and oppressive, only light flickering glow of priests tattoos.
- If questioned, tech-disciples direct them to High Luminen Ossifa, who hosts the Agents in a spartan chamber of engraved stone
- Her golden skin ripples with potential energy, grounded by an electroleech stave capped with a sharpened pick. She is honest and direct
	- cheerfully admits to attacking the Tech Crypt
	- tipped off about the Tech Crypt by the Secutarii of the Legio Karutho
	- horrified to discover the massive amounts of wasted energy powering the stasis-coffin.
	- hired a gang called the Hardwares, a crew of tech-gangers distinguished by their blood-red cybernetic arms. The Hardwares were the cannon fodder, whilst she provided Tech-Priest authorisation access.
	- The attack was a success. They tore out the stasis-coffin, and ended the blasphemous waste of energy.
	- Ossifa doesn’t know what was in the stasis-coffin, and she doesn’t care. She left it with the Hardwares, along with the tech-adept supervisor in charge of the thing. They mentioned escaping aboard the Stronos Space Elevator

#### Long Day at the Office
Location: Belaxia (general)

- How do they track down Amiga?
	- City records (influence DN 5)
	- Hacking surveillance (DN 7)
	- Historic surveillance footage inside the tech crypt
	- Records in the crypt
	- Failure results in complication that takes longer and advances the clock
- They can learn the following:
	- Biran Amiga hasn’t visited his home or work since the attack.
	- He has used his adept credentials to reserve transportation capacity in the Stronos Space Elevator destined for the Delta-Sig-Novem orbital platform. Transit tomorrow
	- He worked constantly, never leaving the stasis-coffin
	- He filed a requisition order to install a hydration unit at his workstation, so he could attend the stasis-coffin longer without refreshment breaks.
	- Amiga is constantly muttering a one-sided dialogue with the stasis-coffin 


#### Elevator Pitch
Scene: Space Elevator

The Stronos Space Elevator is a miracle of Imperial technology, a lifeline connecting Belaxia to the prosperity of Avachrus’s orbital ring. A pair of rails secure the transit of two massive rocket-powered freight cars to Delta-Sig-Novem station.

Surrounding the rails are the conveniences of a port district. Gigantic warehouses of armoured containers are sized to precise Departmento Munitorum specifications. Galvanic servohaulers swarm over cargo shipments, overseen by auto-cranes hanging from the city’s roof like stalactites.

- Are the agents aware of when Amiga left? 
- Are the agents aware of the Hardwares?
	- Do they search the port for the Hardwares?

the Agents may stake out the port for gangers with blood-red prosthetics, following the remaining Hardwares to the stasis-coffin. A **DN 6 Awareness (Int)** Test identifies the Hardwares before they board their flight. Failing this Test identifies the Hardwares after they’ve boarded — the Agents are forced to travel in the next car.

#### Rising Pressure
The elevator interiors are cavernous, 50m across in both directions, with little segmentation. Towers of mag-locked containers, specialist cargo, and a thick press of servitors and adepts are bundled inside together. After a few minutes of total darkness, Agents on the edge catch a rare sight of Avachrus’ surface through armaglass windows. Broad panes of archeotech solar collectors cover the Eternal Engines, powering forge cities, orbital stations and the elevators that connect them, similar in scale to the one they are riding.

- Hardwares are hassling tech adepts and others and a fight breaks out unless the PCs intervene
- 3 Hardwares per agent (tech-gangers)
	- Gunfight results in mass slaughter of the crowd - Fear or Corruption tests as needed

Assuming the Agents survive and capture a Hardware, the prospect of pain (**DN 3 Intimidation (Wil) Test**) or leniency (**DN 3 Deception (Fel)** or **Persuasion (Fel) Test**) convinces the tech-gangers to crack under interrogation. They confirm:

- They are travelling to Odo, Avachrus’ silvery moon, to attend an auction for the stasis-coffin.
- The rest of the gang, along with Amiga and the stasis-coffin, are already on Odo, preparing to host the event.
  - The second team don’t know what is inside the stasis-coffin. But they know a lot of awful people want it very badly, and were willing to pay a life-changing sum for it.
    
If the Hardwares all perish, searching their bodies discovers an invitation to the auction on Odo.

#### Top Floor
Delta-Sig-Novem is an Imperial shipyard specialising in voidship armour repairs, one of many installations comprising the orbital ring of spacedocks around Avachrus.

When the freight car arrives, Skitarii and clean-up crews swarm the bloody aftermath of the elevator firefight.
- How do the PCs respond to this?

- Do the PCs know about the auction yet? 
- Roll DN3 Cunning or Insight to figure out where to gather information. Investigating the whereabouts of the Hardwares or Amiga leads them to:

##### The Gritty Swarf
- A grimy bar for merchants, mercenaries, and scoundrels traveling to and fro through the spaceport.
- If they ask around, someone will point them to Captain Adesina
- Captain Adesina: rotund, jocular, slovenly, cunning
	- Captain Adesina knows about the auction on Odo. 
	- He's heard about some valuables being sold off there to offworld buyers. It's not in his interest to know what. But he does know where and when. That is in his interest to know.
	- He'll take the PCs there in his ship, but not for cheap - he wants 2 wealth worth of goods.
