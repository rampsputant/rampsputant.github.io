#### Recap - What Was Learned
- The party is working for Jakel Varonius, seeking to investigate a mysterious source of water and find out if it can be turned to a profit.
- They met with Enforcer Rashida Kandlan, who told them there were cults active. She asked them to investigate and resolve the mystery.
- They went into the refugee camp where they learned about two competing factions, The Water Bringers and the Deluge. They learned this from Charlie Scavver, a latent psycher eager to help them. A little too eager.
- They went to the Deluge hideout, where supposedly the deluge had a way of producing water. They found a giant water purification device that had been corrupted to convert human blood into water. The Deluge were sacrificing other refugees and draining their blood.
- The party killed the deluge. Octaviano managed to break the water purification machine without damaging it too severely (he got a shock for his troubles)
- They also tracked down and killed Charlie Scavver - Chris's character did some ritual murder on his ass.

## Strong Start - Searching the Camp
**Scene: Refugee Camp
Character: Raoul Inglis**
Raoul is a scoundrel who previously worked for the smuggler Barnard Vanderscorn, but has been stranded here on Enoch since his last job went sideways. Raoul has been looking for a way off-world. He followed the PCs, saw they have influence. He saw them go with Scavver, knew they were heading for the Deluge. He thought that would be the end of them, but he was pleasantly surprised when they cleaned up the Deluge.

He would like to assist them, if they can help him get off-world. He can make himself useful in a fight, if it comes to that. 

He knows the location of the Water Shrine and can give the party advantage on negotiation checks if he is present and if he tells the group the party eliminated the Deluge.

If Raoul is not present, the characters will have to gather information using Investigation, Intimidation, or Persuasion skills. Ask the players how they are doing it. They need 2 successes or 1 critical success. A complication means the loss of an item. Failure simply delays them longer and makes them tired. -1 on Willpower tests until the end of the scene.

**Faustus Cherubo - working with the Water Bringers - target of Gisbern's assassination
### The Water Bringers
**Scene: The Water Shrine**
**Character: Tybalt**

One way or another, the characters reach the Water Shrine. It's an abandoned Imperial Shrine that's been taken over by the Water Bringer cult and surrounded with armed guards wearing religious paraphanalia, a number of whom have skinplants. 

**Awareness DN 2**: Notably, all of them look clean, like they've bathed. That's something of a rarity here. 

If the characters approach or attempt to enter, a guard approaches and introduces himself as Tybalt. He asks them who they are, who they serve, and what they want. He is skeptical of them - he's worried they are here to take away Saint Martika.

He will share some information on a DN 3 test
He will permit the PCs to attend the next ceremony on a DN 3 test
He will not allow the PCs to meet Saint Martika in person without a DN 5 deception test and a convincing lie.

Info:
- He believes Martika is a saint
- She can bring forth water from the shrine to the emperor
- She appeared several months ago and was able to make water. No one knows much about her. She is special - speaks only of holy visions of the emperor. She goes into a trance and water comes.
- It is a miracle!

**Scene: The Blessing**
**Characters: Saint Martika, Gond**
The shrine walls are lined with statues depicting various Imperial Saints and heroes. All of the statues have empty barrels surrounding them. Someone rings a bell over the shrine and over the next hour, the area of the small shrine fills in as hundreds of refugees come to witness the miracle. The guards have circled around to cover the entrance and exits.



Once the cult is assembled, Saint Martika enters the room, accompanied by her bodyguard, who Gisbern recognizes as Faustus. The Saint is a pale, pretty young woman with strange, glowing eyes and arms lined with a blue skinplant mosaic. 

The Saint kneels upon a dais and begins to pray to the Emperor for his mercy. Her voice rings out in tones so clear the statues in the hall seem to resonate with it. As she continues to pray, the characters can feel moisture rising in the hall. As her prayer reaches its crescendo, the Water Bringers all cry out and water bursts from the eyes and hands of the statues about the hall in torrents, flooding down to fill the barrels about their pedestals to overflowing, causing cultists to swiftly run for more buckets and rags to soak up the excess.

At any time, Barry can make a Psychic Mastery test DN 3 to determine that she is a rogue psyker channeling the Warp. If they can get to her in person, someone can make a Medicae test DC 3 to make the same determination.

If the characters do nothing, the event goes off without a hitch unless Barry rolls a complication. If the characters interfere or there is a complication on any test. Martika gets agitated, lightning starts to pour from her eyes, and her body suddenly explodes in a ball of gore and lightning as a Pink Horror erupts from her body. 
- Corruption Test DN 5
- Each round they need to make a test to move through the throng of panicked people trying to escape the horror

If the characters attack before the Pink Horror happens, they will face down Martika, Gond, and 8 cultists.
### Wrap Up
- Aftermath 
	- They find some religious trinkets in the shrine worth 2 wealth each
- Reclaiming the device in the Basement
- Return to Kandlan
	- If there was no pink demon event, she's grateful for any information.
	- If the pink demon happened, she's angry and upset. Word has already gotten out and an inquisitor is on his way. It'll be exterminatus for all of them for sure! She's planning to skip town.
- Return to Varonius or Meet the Inquisitor?
- Rewards - 20 XP

### Recap with Varonius
**Scene: The Bridge**
**NPC: Jakel Varonius**
The PCs return to Varonius' flagship. They meet with Varonius in a private, velvet covered stateroom. Varonius wants to know about the newcomers and what happened on Enoch.
- He will accept the newcomers into his service if they are willing to serve him loyally and without question.
- He is pleased about the recovery of the water purification device.
- If the demon appeared, he has already heard word of it from Inquisitor Dikaisune. Dikaisune tried to throw it into his face, but Varonius was pleased with how the characters handled the situation.
- He rewards them with a weapon. They can choose one of the following:
	- Neural whip
	- Power sword
	- hot-shot laspistol
	- plasma pistol
- He directs the PCs to the Mechanicus Armory on deck 67 to pick up their gear. Simply present their symbol of authority to Techmagos Cantor there.
- In any case, he is pleased and tells them they've earned some R&R time. He encourages them to explore the ship and avail themselves of its facilities. He will summon them for a new mission forthwith.
- The party gains 1 Glory

### Exploring the Varonius Flagship - The Ducal Circlet
**Scene: Ship Map**
The Grand Cruiser flagship is enormous, comprising over a hundred decks and housing some 
#### The Exarch's Canteen
Scene: TBD
A high-end slum - this isn't where the upper crust dine in their finery, but rather more like a high-end club in London. Eating and drinking on the upper floors, dancing and gambling on the lower. Women or men for the right price.
**NPC: Barnard VanderScorn** - merchant, informant, former pirate, smuggler, all-around scoundrel
- Former employer of Raoul
- Has many "official" enemies in the system, hence his interest in protection from Varonius
- Sells information and illegal goods
- Buys illegal goods such as xenotech
- Wants to get in good with the PCs as he has heard they are in favor with Varonius
Rittor - dancer in the club who gave Barry info
#### The Mechanicus Armory
**Scene: Armory**
A warehouse filled with arrays of imperial equipment of all sorts and manufacture. The PCs can acquire new wargear here. 
**NPC: Techmagos Cantor** (they/them) - merchant who gives side-quests
- Supports Varonius where convenient
- Prime motive is to gather forgotten/losttech and xenos tech and secure it for transport back to Mars whenever that may become possible.
- They let the PCs know that any items of unusual make and manufacture they come across that may be of interest that the Rogue Trader has not explicity laid claim to should be brought to them. They will pay handsomely for it, such as granting access to rarer stashes of equipment.
- They and the other tech priests are not specifically aligned with the techpriests on Avachrus, but they share the same ultimate goal of serving the Omnissiah.
- Logic above all
- All praise the omnissiah

#### The Grand Basilica
**Scene: Basilica**
A giant church where services are held in praise of the emperor - prayers all hours of the day. The PCs may come here to pray or seek solitude. If they wish to pray or meditate, have them make a Will test, DN 3. On a success, they gain a Point of Wrath.
- ask them to describe what they meditate on

#### The Bridge
The PCs can visit the bridge to speak with Varonius or gain access to the map of the system. The Bridge is where they start.

#### The Eye of the Inquisitor
**Scene: A quiet hallway**
**NPC: Inquisitor Tytrona Dikaisune**

After the PCs have visited two of the locations, Gisbern receives a summons to a private location on deck 41. The message simply says to come alone. It's stamped with the seal of the Imperial Inquisition.

**NPC: Inquisitor Dikaisune** - Puritanical/traditional, cunning, practical, dangerous
- Suspectly believes that Varonius must have employed some heresy to come thru the Cicatrix Maledictum unscathed, but keeps this belief to herself until she can uncover evidence
- Is concerned about Varonius' power in the system and sees it as her role to keep him in check
- Admires Gisbern's faithfulness to the emperor. She heard about how he handled himself on Enoch and was impressed. 
- Admits she is concerned about Varonius' choice to employ mutants, tech-priests, and psykers. Only Gisbern is trustworthy.
- Tells him that she believes Varonius is misguided. In his quest for ever-more wealth, Varonius is prone to making questionable judgments that could put the system at risk. 
- She wants Gisbern to send an alert if he suspects any heresy is afoot, or if he encounters anything he knows she would wish to know about. 
- She reminds Gisbern that she can be an invaluable ally - or a terrible enemy
- She gives him a simple beacon device. Activating it allows him to send a single message and to transmit a location.
- She warns him to speak not to his other colleagues, lest suspicion cloud their judgment. 

### Summons from Varonius
**Location: Bridge**
**NPC: Varonius**

Varonius has judged the operators are useful at dealing with complex and difficult situations. He has two jobs where he believes their work could be useful. He asks them to choose based on where they think they would best excel.

Job 1:
The influential ruler of Avachrus, Archdomina Vakuul, has requested assistance in locating and securing a missing artifact. Vakuul is looking for operators who can be discrete and who are discreet and can avoid attracting too much attention. Varonius is keen to have Vakuul in his debt as the current ruler of Avachrus. Additionally, having a tech-priest of Avachrus in the party could open some doors.

Job 2: 
The Paktherius Manufactorum provided a vital outpuyt of quality Servitors for use across the system. However, in recent weeks, the Manufactorum wemt dark. There is no sign of life from the outside, and heavily armed Gun Servitors prevent all but the most determined from entering to investigate. Discovering what happened will take plenty of cunning, but will also likely be incredibly dangerous. Still, restoring the Manufactorum and securing a flow of quality servitors would be an extremely valuable addition to the Varonius portfolio.

In either case, he will forward the mission briefing details and next steps to their Dataslates. He grants them access to a Valkyrie ship and access to any common or uncommon Imperial-keyed equipment
