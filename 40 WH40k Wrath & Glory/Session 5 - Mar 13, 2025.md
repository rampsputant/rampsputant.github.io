## Overview
The PCs go to the auction where they finally locate the missing Stasis Coffin. However, there are many other interested parties. Will they make it out with the coffin or will they die trying?

## Intro
- Good chance this will be our final session of this mission
- Mission recap, below

## Mission Recap
Working in the employ of Rogue Trader Jakel Varonious, the party was hired to meet with  Archdomina Vakuul, the high Tech Priest of the forge city of Belaxia on Avachrus. Vakuul indicated that a rare and valuable stasis coffin was stolen from a Tech Crypt. The coffin belonged to a powerful figure, and for it to come to light that Vakuul had lost it would be extremely bad, so she urged you to use the utmost care and caution in your investigation. 

During their investigations, the party learned that the stasis coffin had been stolen by a gang with the assistance of a Tech Custodian named Amiga who was caring for the stasis coffin. There were heretical markings on Amiga's jacket. 

After some data gathering at the city's bureacratic offices, the party located Amiga's home, which had seen no signs of habitation for some time, a fact validated by his neighbor. While there, the party crossed paths with an investigator named Lockson who claimed to be following up on the theft. The party threatened him and warned him off the case.

After a violent altercation in the undercity at the Tune Up Cybersurgery Bar, the party learned that the smugglers were a gang called the Hardwares, that they wore red painted augmetics, and that if they were smuggling soemthing off Avachrus, it would be via the space elevator. The party then went to the elevator yards where they convinced local security to round up the Hardwares. After levaraging some questionable interrogation methods, they got one of the Hardwares to provide details:

The gang had already smuggled Amiga and the stasis coffin off the surface to a mining colony on the moon Odo, where there was to be an auction for the coffin and its contents. The Hardwares were set to get rich. The gang member who flipped, Snidelock, provided them with an invitation to the auction in exchange for his freedom.

The party ascended the space elevator up to the Delta-Sig-Novem station and searched around until they found a bar of disreputable quality where they asked around about the Hardwares and Amiga. While they didn't know of the Hardwares specifically, they knew about the black market auction, and the party met a pilot willing to take them to the mining colony: Captain Adesina 

### Start - The Gritty Swarf
- Talk with Adesina:
	- Rotund, jocular, slovenly, cunning
		- Captain Adesina knows about the auction on Odo. 
		- He's heard about some valuables being sold off there to offworld buyers. It's not in his interest to know what. But he does know where and when. That is in his interest to know.
		- He'll take the PCs there in his ship, but not for cheap - he wants 2 wealth worth of goods.
- The auction is tomorrow night, and the flight will take several hours, so the PCs have the afternoon/evening to themselves.

The next day, Adesina takes them to the abandoned mining colony. 

### Odo - The Mining Colony
Odo is ugly and lifeless, a desert world scarred by centuries of erosion. Travel ends at an old mining habitat with a silo-entrance that opens and closes to accept the approaching shuttle. Inside the hangar,  a cluster of four other void landers demonstrate the Agents are not alone — but the only Human presence is a servitor, pointing the way through similarly bleak hallways.

Cold stone gives way to red carpeting that has been hastily put down in the central hall of the mining colony. Distorted, looping orchestral music recordings pour from a constantly malfunctioning mechanism and drift across a large room that once served as a recreation centre.

Against a wall, as far as possible from both entrances, is the stasis-coffin itself. It is large and imposing, too heavy for any single person to shift, and gently whines as its last battery power diminishes. A tired looking tech-adept with bloodshot eyes is fidgeting over the controls on the device. 

A group of tech-gangers--you recognize some of the Hardwares among them--nervously serve canapes and drinks to small clusters of guests. It's the guests who immediately draw your attention - strange men and women openly wearing jewelry and tattoos marking them as followers of chaos, and warp-tainted Xenos with cruel, alien eyes. And among one of the groups - who at first appear to be black market merchants - you recognize the investigator you threatened in Amiga's apartment - Investigator Lockson.

As you enter, polite conversation dies and dozens of armed heretics and xenos turn to face you. The silence is interrupted by a terrified tech-ganger steps in front of you. "Excuse me my lords - this is a private affair. Do you have an invitation?"

- The auction will take place in about 1 hour of real time, offering the PCs a limited amount of time to gather info or network
- There are a number of artifacts availble in a Silent Auction that the PCs can also bid on. The Silent Auction will be resolved before the live auction.
- There are five different groups in the area:
	- The Hosts (The Hardwares, including Biran Amiga)
	- The Hunters (Aeldari Corsairs led by Kasque)
	- The Fanatics (Tetritta the Cult Leader)
	- The Scoundrels (Lin the Ogryn and Roco the Ratling)
	- Locson and the Astra Militarum troopers

#### The Hosts
**The Hardwares**
- Whilst most groups are keeping to themselves, the remaining Hardwares are drifting around the room, offering drinks and keeping the peace.
- The Hardwares don’t have time to answer questions. They assume the Agents already know what they’re purchasing, and will be alarmed and suspicious if they indicates otherwise. 
- If the Agents ask any technical questions, they are directed to the red-robed man tending to the coffin, but warned not to get too close.
**Amiga**
- Tired, bloodshot eyes centre a mostly metal face, never resting for long. The tech-adept is intensely agitated, fussing around the stasis-coffin and making small adjustments with his combi-tool.
- He doesn’t have time for the Agents either, but if they offer to help and pass a DN 5 Tech (Int) Test to indicate expertise, he will ask for technical advice and talk whilst he works.
	- **The stasis-field is shutting down. The coffin has been disconnected from a stationary power source for too long.** Amiga is trying his hardest to keep it running (if the Agents passed their Tech Test, it buys some time), but he’s fighting a losing battle. Still, he’ll die before he abandons his duty.
	- He’s not really paid attention to the Hardwares or their heretical guests. All that matters is keeping the stasis-coffin shut.
	- If the Agents reveal Vakuul sent them to retrieve the stasis-coffin, Amiga is delighted, and offers to collaborate.The best help he can provide is to keep doing what he’s doing for as long as it works.
	- The stasis-coffin contains a monster. If it opens, everyone in the room, and millions across the Gilead System, will die. He cannot advise how to confront it, only how to prevent it escaping.
	- If the Agents offer to take over his duty, he is grateful, but advises the other buyers in the room will shoot them if they touch the stasis-coffin.

#### The Hunters
- Closest to the desert-entrance are a band of swaggering Aeldari Corsairs, wearing the chequered jade mesh of Greensteel Warriors.
- Their leader is bare-chested and unarmoured, with drug-infused sweat dripping across his alien, shamanic tattoos.
- If approached, he insults and taunts the PCs, but will share the following information:
	- He believes the Agents to be Inquisitorial agents, but doesn’t much care. It amuses him to watch the Mon-Keigh squabble amongst themselves.
	- His unit did not travel on a voidship. They don’t appear to have crossed the silver desert. He provides no explanation of how he arrived.
	- Kasque is an outcast from the Drukhari, forced to leave the Dark City after an unfortunate incident he refers to as ‘The Throneblooding’.
	- He has learned the stasis-coffin contains a rare and dangerous animal, a novelty in the Wych Cult arenas. If he brings it back alive, it will purchase his return to Drukhari society.
- Whilst Kasque talks, the Corsairs pass around a stolen collection of exquisitely rare Imperial artworks, mocking the crude brush strokes. A **DN 5 Scholar (Int) Test** values the collection at 8 Wealth.

#### The Fanatics
Near the stasis-coffin, clustered around a half-broken table, is a gang dressed in thick, rough gorx-leathers. Some of them have grotesque bulging mutations and a number of them openly wear the eight-pointed symbol of the chaos gods.

If the PCs approach the stasis coffin, the cultists become aggressive and threatening. But if the PCs engage, their leader spokeswoman **Tetritta** engages the PCs. 

- Her cult is devoted to the Chaos Gods, the only true powers in this universe.
- She led their cult’s voidcraft to Odo after receiving dark visions of a stasis-coffin containing the corpse of their Dark Messiah. Today, He shall be resurrected, and reward their loyal service.
- All who defy the majesty of the Ruinous Powers shall perish! The False Emperor’s failing rule over the Gilead System is at an end!
- She recommends the pungent ‘Grox’ rolls.

Agents who listen to Tetritta’s blasphemy must take a **DN 3 Corruption Test**. However, they will also learn that her followers are carrying cases of silver coinage worth 9 Wealth, and are not very subtle about it.

#### The Scoundrels
Led by an ogryn (Lin) and Ratling (Roco) on his back, a crew of pirate Scum congregates near the recreation room’s hangar-entrance, drinking amasec and telling dirty jokes. 

If engaged in convo, Roco takes the lead and is willing to share the following:
- Their crew is an unrepentant mob of brutes, cut-throats, wastrels, and thieves, and proud of it.
- Roco offers the Agents a drink. The other guests seem too uptight to enjoy a good party, and it’s a shame for the amasec he brought to go to waste.
- They flew here on behalf of a buyer who paid a good price to retrieve the stasis-coffin. If asked to name their employer, Roco claims it’s Jakel Varonius, (Insight DN 1 to detect the lie).
- Their employer didn’t mention what was in the coffin, but Roco reckons it’s the lost Chapter Master of the Absolvers. (Another joke, though ironically, the closest to the truth.)

Sizing up Roco in conversation, and passing a **DN 5 Cunning (Fel) Test**, suggests his crew are carrying no more than 6 Wealth in various currencies. It’s not enough to win the auction, but the Agents might consider pooling their resources with Roco’s crew. If the Agents can promise a cut of their second payment from Vakuul, Roco cheerfully abandons his former employer and switches sides.

#### The Black Marketeers
Lockson will approach the PCs at some point if they don't approach him first. Lockson has figured out the following:
- The PCs are working for Vakuul 
- They are searching for the stolen stasis coffin
- The stasis coffin contains a dangerous creature that under no circumstances must be allowed to escape its confinement
-
Lockson distrusts the PCs but is willing to negotiate with them. If they question him, he reveals he is an agent of the Holy Inquisition and he knows they are working for Vakuul. They are all, given the circumstances, temporarily on the same side.

- Reports to Inquisitor Dikaisune
- Lockson and his team have 4 wealth work of resources available (on short notice)

### The Auction
Assuming the Agents have neither started a fight, nor enacted a disruptive scheme, the auction proceeds as the Hardwares intend. An augmented merchant with wealthy-looking augmetics and finely groomed gray hair runs the auction.

The full auction proceeds as follows:

- Roco opens the bidding at 1 Wealth. The Agents may increase the bid with a greater amount of Wealth. Fractions are not permitted.
    
- When making a new bid, Agents can choose to project an aura of supreme confidence that knocks one other faction out of the auction — they assume the Agents are so committed that attempting to out-bid them is a lost cause! This is a **Cunning (Fel), Deception (Fel)** or **Intimidation (Wil) Test**, with a DN equal to the faction’s Wealth -3.
    
- If the Agents increase the bid, another faction bids 1 Wealth higher. Rotate which faction bids - Roco, then Kasque, then Tetritta, then Lockson. Skip factions that have been knocked out or cannot afford the new price.
    
- Instead of increasing the bid, the Agents can sit out the rest of the auction. In their absence, Tetritta wins the stasis-coffin at 9 Wealth.
    
- If the Agents make a bid at 10 or more Wealth, they win the auction.

The Agents may bid more Wealth than they have. Since the Hardwares demand payment as soon as bidding closes, this ruse is quickly discovered, triggering a violent escalation (see **Going Loud**).

If the Agents win and fulfil their bid, the relieved Hardwares hand over the stasis-coffin and Amiga, then immediately flee. The other bidders are less accepting of this outcome. The Agents barely make it to their ship before Tetritta’s cult attacks — Lin and Roco’s pirates act at the same time, hoping to steal the stasis-coffin in the confusion, but fleeing stern resistance. Kasque and Unification are more patient, staging an Aeldari Corsair raid on Delta-Sig-Novem, or ambushing the Agents when they reach apparent safety in Belaxia, respectively.

If anyone else wins the auction, violence breaks out.

#### COMBAT
- There are many, many ways the auction could turn violent.
- the four enemy Mobs are not allies, and may be persuaded to turn guns on each other instead of the Agents. With cunning and good fortune, the Agents may capture the stasis-coffin whilst everyone else is distracted. 
- 
If the Agents roll a **Complication** — or if Tetritta’s Cultists reach the stasis-coffin with a spare Combat Action — Biran Amiga catches a stray shot and is incapacitated. Without his maintenance, **the stasis-coffin shuts down.** At the end of the turn, a crash of blows inside the coffin heralds the emergence of The Entombed Champion. The Chaos Space Marine Warlord, magnificent and terrible in his red and black power armour, seizes a heavy mining tool, and sets about the recreation room in a frenzy. All Agents must make a **DN 4 Corruption** Test.

The Champion’s only weakness is a defective Catalepsean Node, the Astartes organ that should allow full combat efficiency whilst badly fatigued. Instead, the warrior is exhausted from long-term stasis, regaining his faculties at reduced speed, leaving a narrow window in which to defeat him:

- On his first turn, The Entombed Champion is Blinded, Exhausted, and Vulnerable (2). He is not fully conscious, but battles relying on his armour’s awakening auto-senses.
    
- On his second turn, The Entombed Champion’s spirit begins to stir. He is no longer Blinded, but remains Exhausted and Vulnerable (2).
    
- On his third turn, The Entombed Champion growls menacingly, before a voice in the Agents’ minds speaks the words ‘ATTEND ME. THIS BLOOD MUST BE TALLIED’. He is no longer Vulnerable (2), and this is his last turn being Exhausted.
    
- From his fourth turn onwards, the veil of reality gives way. Two Bloodletters enter the fight every turn. The Entombed Champion fights at full effectiveness.

If the Agents cannot defeat the Champion in combat, they can trap or manoeuvre him back into his accursed prison. Reactivating the stasis-coffin requires a **DN 6 Tech (Int) Test**. Alternatively, if an Agent reaches Amiga within two turns, a **DN 5 Medicae (Int) Test** revives him, and he reactivates the stasis-coffin. Forcing the Champion back inside requires a successful grapple — if an Agent succeeds on the **Opposed Strength Test**, the Champion is not _Restrained_, but instead is forced a Standard Move of distance in a direction the Agent chooses.

### RESOLUTION

The adventure could end in a number of ways:

If the Agents return the stasis-coffin to Vakuul (or the Secutarii) with The Entombed Champion intact, they are rewarded as promised. If the Agents also stayed ahead of the Inquisition, they earn a grateful patron, motivated to keep the Agents satisfied and tight-lipped. Eventually, Vakuul passes the stasis-coffin onto Inquisitor Argyle. If the Agents discovered the stasis-coffin contained a Chaos Space Marine and thought to mention it to Vakuul, she warns the Inquisition and the Champion is destroyed. If not, well, accidents happen.

- If the Agents return the stasis-coffin after the Inquisition discovers it was stolen, they are caught up in a power struggle. They may still receive payment, if they make it to Avachrus quickly enough. An investigative probe into Vakuul’s failure follows, with the Agents called as witnesses. To save themselves, they must make careful choices about whom to betray.
    
- If The Entombed Champion is killed, sacrificed, or enslaved by the Drukhari, the Agents have failed their mission. Returning the stasis-coffin without The Entombed Champion inside is not successful, and interpreted by the Archdomina as an insult. The Agents’ best hope is to loot what they can from Odo, and escape Avachrus as quickly as possible, dodging any pursuing Inquisitorial acolytes and Sicarian assassins.
    
- If the Agents are captured by the Inquisition, they are escorted to the Ordo Hereticus’ interrogation chambers on Imperia. If they have proven themselves dangerous liabilities, the Agents will likely never escape. If they have instead demonstrated capability, they are forced to divulge all they know about Vakuul’s attempted cover-up, then recruited as double-agents. The Agents work for the Ordo Hereticus now.
    
- If The Entombed Champion escapes Odo, he calls forth a legion of corrupted powers. Cultists, daemons and Heretic Astartes flock to his banner, recognising a leader who could return them to dominance. A new, even darker age for the Gilead System looms ahead.
