## Overview
Battle Royale! Will the PCs escape alive? Will the Dark Champion be freed of its prison? Will the Inquisition bring everyone to heel?

## Intro
- Recap last session

## Sitrep
Essentially six groups: 
- The Hardwares (serving drinks and looking increasingly uneasy) - about 10 of them who duck and/or run for cover as soon as the shooting starts
- The Scum pirates led by Lin and Rocco - L&R + 5 Scum
- Inquisitorial Acolyte Lockson with five shock troopers
- Aeldari Corsair Baron Kasque with four aeldari rangers
- Five cultists, whose leader was just blasted through the head and who fell through a hole accidentally burned through the floor
- You guys

Roll for Initative!
### Combat Notes
- The normies do not get Shock - all damage after resilience goes to wounds
- If Amiga is killed or prevented from attending to the Stasis Coffin, it will shut down at the end of the turn and open, unless someone else keeps it operating with a DN 5 Tech test, which is a full round action that must be completed every round.

#### Faction Goals
- **Cultists:** **Kill Amiga** and free their Chaos Master
- **Aeldari:** Kill all the humans; gain control of the Stasis Coffin and use their own tech to keep it in stasis
- **Lockson and crew:** Kill the Cultists and the aliens to prevent them seizing or escaping with the Stasis Coffin; secondarily keep Baran Amiga alive and the stasis coffin functional.
- **Scum Pirates:** Let everyone else kill each other and take down anyone who threatens them and looks weak. If the situation looks advantageous, seize valuables and escape. If things look grim, make a break for it and plant explosives on the other ships.
- The Hardwares and their henchmen: Take their ill-gotten loot and flee while they still can. (Any of them who hang around are caught in the crossfire and killed)

#### Entombed Champion
*The Chaos Space Marine Warlord, magnificent and terrible in his red and black power armour, seizes a heavy mining tool, and sets about the recreation room in a frenzy.* 
- All Agents must make a **DN 4 Corruption** Test.

The Champion’s only weakness is a defective Catalepsean Node. The warrior is exhausted from long-term stasis, regaining his faculties at reduced speed, leaving a narrow window in which to defeat him:

- On his first turn, The Entombed Champion is **Blinded, Exhausted, and Vulnerable (2).** He is not fully conscious, but battles relying on his armour’s awakening auto-senses.
- On his second turn, The Entombed Champion’s spirit begins to stir. He is no longer Blinded, but remains **Exhausted and Vulnerable (2).**
- On his third turn, *The Entombed Champion growls menacingly, before a voice in the Agents’ minds speaks the words ‘ATTEND ME. THIS BLOOD MUST BE TALLIED’.* He is no longer Vulnerable (2), and **this is his last turn being Exhausted.**    
- From his fourth turn onwards, the veil of reality gives way. **Two Bloodletters enter the fight every turn. The Entombed Champion fights at full effectiveness.**
    
If the Agents cannot defeat the Champion in combat, they can trap or manoeuvre him back into his accursed prison. Reactivating the stasis-coffin requires a **DN 6 Tech (Int) Test**. Alternatively, if an Agent reaches Amiga within two turns, a **DN 5 Medicae (Int) Test** revives him, and he reactivates the stasis-coffin. Forcing the Champion back inside requires a successful grapple — if an Agent succeeds on the **Opposed Strength Test**, the Champion is not _Restrained_, but instead is forced a Standard Move of distance in a direction the Agent chooses.

### RESOLUTION
- Did the PCs survive?
- Did Lockson survive?
- Did the Entombed Chaos Space Marine Champion escape?
- Was the Champion defeated?

Gisbern notified Inquisitor Dikaisune about the chaos space marine, so the moon will be eradicated.
- Vakuul will be demoted for her failure to protect the artifact and for failing to discover its true nature sooner
- Varonius will undergo a formal Inquisitorial Investigation for his involvement

The PCs position is precarious, particularly if the Entombed Champion is freed or escapes
- Lockson puts in a good word for them if they helped defeat the Entombed Champion

If they try to seek out Vakuul, they learn that she has been removed from her position. No one knows what has become of her, but already the politicking is beginning for her seat.

When they return to Varonius's ship, they are arrested by Inquisitorial agents upon boarding (or perhaps before they even reach the ship)
- Varonius comes to visit them in prison. He apologizes for their current predicament, but there is little that can be done. They are at the mercy of the Inquisition now.

After some time, they are masked and chained and brought into a sleek, black room filled with implements of torture. Inquisitor Dikaisune is there, along with several Inquisitorial interrogators. Dikaisune asks for a full report on the events. She also asks about Varonius, his motives, and the people on his ship
- If the PCs have a favorable reputation from Lockson, and they tell the story in a way that is favorable to them, and they are willing to turn evidence on Varonius and those on his ship, she will instate them as Inquisitorial Operatives. They are given rewards of 5 wealth each and will be given Inquisitorial Symbols of Authority of the Ordo Hereticus
- Otherwise, Gisbern will be recognized and brought to their side.
- Octaviano will be sent to work the blast furnaces, Krunk will be placed in an Imperial penal mining colony, and Barry will be slaved to the Astronomican Choir of an Imperial Cruiser that will soon attempt to penetrate the Great Rift to restore contact to the Imperium. It will almost certainly result in the ship's loss, but it is a necessary loss.

If the PCs survive, they earn 50xp

The adventure could end in a number of ways:

If the Agents return the stasis-coffin to Vakuul (or the Secutarii) with The Entombed Champion intact, they are rewarded as promised. If the Agents also stayed ahead of the Inquisition, they earn a grateful patron, motivated to keep the Agents satisfied and tight-lipped. Eventually, Vakuul passes the stasis-coffin onto Inquisitor Argyle. If the Agents discovered the stasis-coffin contained a Chaos Space Marine and thought to mention it to Vakuul, she warns the Inquisition and the Champion is destroyed. If not, well, accidents happen.

- If the Agents return the stasis-coffin after the Inquisition discovers it was stolen, they are caught up in a power struggle. They may still receive payment, if they make it to Avachrus quickly enough. An investigative probe into Vakuul’s failure follows, with the Agents called as witnesses. To save themselves, they must make careful choices about whom to betray.
    
- If The Entombed Champion is killed, sacrificed, or enslaved by the Drukhari, the Agents have failed their mission. Returning the stasis-coffin without The Entombed Champion inside is not successful, and interpreted by the Archdomina as an insult. The Agents’ best hope is to loot what they can from Odo, and escape Avachrus as quickly as possible, dodging any pursuing Inquisitorial acolytes and Sicarian assassins.
    
- If the Agents are captured by the Inquisition, they are escorted to the Ordo Hereticus’ interrogation chambers on Imperia. If they have proven themselves dangerous liabilities, the Agents will likely never escape. If they have instead demonstrated capability, they are forced to divulge all they know about Vakuul’s attempted cover-up, then recruited as double-agents. The Agents work for the Ordo Hereticus now.
    
- If The Entombed Champion escapes Odo, he calls forth a legion of corrupted powers. Cultists, daemons and Heretic Astartes flock to his banner, recognising a leader who could return them to dominance. A new, even darker age for the Gilead System looms ahead.
